The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young Midwesterner who moves to Long Island in New York and becomes neighbors with Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic and wealthy man known for his extravagant parties. As Nick becomes acquainted with the members of the upper-class society, he learns about Gatsby's obsession with Daisy Buchanan, Nick's cousin, and his desire to recapture their past romantic relationship. Gatsby's extravagant lifestyle, wealth, and secretive nature spark Nick's curiosity and he gradually uncovers the truth about Gatsby's past and his pursuit of the American Dream. The novel explores themes of love, the corruption of the American Dream, and the emptiness of materialism, ultimately culminating in a tragic and disillusioning ending."
